## DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer

Hi :)âœ¨
This repo is my journey in learning about Deep Learning. I got this opportunity to completed all of this course because of participated in Bangkit Academy 2022.

This course consist of:
- [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
  - Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
  - Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
  - Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
  - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
  
- [DeepLearning.AI Tensoflow: Data and Deployment](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-data-and-deployment)
  - Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js
  - Device-based Models with TensorFlow Lite
  - Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services
  - Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow
